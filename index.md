## About:
I currently hold the position of Bridge to Faculty (B2F) Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois Chicago. Concurrently. My current research focuses on investigating the impact of environmental exposures on children's neurodevelopment. My professional journey has provided me with a diverse background in epidemiology, encompassing environmental, social, and clinical aspects.

I highly appreciate diversity, inclusion, and a sense of belonging. My dedication extends to fostering these principles not only in research, academia, and clinical practice, but also in other spheres.


## Research Areas:
My interests lie in the intersection between environmental exposures and health outcomes, with focus on migrant and Latinx communities:

 -Pediatric environmental health 

 -Migration and health
 
 -Exposure assessment
 
 -Impact of climate change on health
 
 -Global/international health
 
 -Research Translation
 
 -Community-engaged intervention research

In my research, I´m applying the latest generation of quantitative methods in epidemiology and new causal inference methods. Currently, I´m studying the effect of metal mixtures on children’s cognitive abilities and how policy actions can be actionable from hypothetical interventions.
