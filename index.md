## Victor A. Florez-Garcia
  
 

  
## About:
I am an assistant professor at the Department of Public Health at Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla - Colombia. I am a PhD candidate in environmental heath sciences, specializing in environmental epidemiology, at  the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. I work with Dr. Amy Kalkbrenner on environmental exposures that affect neurodevelopment in children. However, I have abroad previous experience in social and clinical epidemiology.

I highly appreciate diversity, inclusion, and a sense of belonging. My dedication extends to fostering these principles not only in research, academia, and clinical practice, but also in other spheres.


## Research Areas:
My interests lie at the intersection between environmental exposures and children´s neurodevelopmental outcomes.  Also, I´m interested in the latest generation of quantitative methods in epidemiology and new causal inference methods. Currently, I´m studying the effect of heavy metal mixtures on children's cognitive abilities.
