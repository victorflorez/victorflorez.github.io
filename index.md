## About:
I currently hold the position of Assistant Professor at the Department of Public Health at Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia. Concurrently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Environmental Health Sciences with a specialization in Environmental Epidemiology at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, under the guidance of Dr. Amy Kalkbrenner. My doctoral research focuses on investigating the impact of environmental exposures on neurodevelopment in children.My professional journey has provided me with a diverse background in epidemiology, encompassing both social and clinical aspects.

I highly appreciate diversity, inclusion, and a sense of belonging. My dedication extends to fostering these principles not only in research, academia, and clinical practice, but also in other spheres.


## Research Areas:
My interests lie in the intersection between environmental exposures and children's cognitive development outcomes. I´m interested in the latest generation of quantitative methods in epidemiology and new causal inference methods. Currently, I´m studying the effect of heavy metal mixtures on children's cognitive abilities and how policy actions can be actionable from hypothetical interventions. There are two additional research interests: a) Migration and health and b) Environmental exposures (metals) and breast cancer.
