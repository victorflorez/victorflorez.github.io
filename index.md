    **About:**

    I am (Victor Florez-Garcia) an assistant professor at the Department of Public Health at Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla - Colombia.


    **Research Areas:** My interests lie at the intersection between environmental exposures and children´s neurodevelopmental outcomes.  Also, I´m interested in the latest generation of quantitative methods in epidemiology and new causal inference methods. Currently, I´m studying the effect of heavy metal mixtures on children's cognitive abilities.
