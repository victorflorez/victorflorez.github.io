## About:
I currently hold the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois Chicago. My current research focuses on investigating the effect of environmental exposures on neurodevelopment and other chronic diseases such as cardiometabolic disease and cancer. My professional journey has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology, encompassing environmental, social, and clinical aspects.


## Research Areas:
My interests lie in the intersection between environmental exposures and health outcomes:

-Environmental epidemiology

-Molecular epidemiology

-Maternal-child health

In my research, I´m applying the latest generation of quantitative methods in epidemiology and new causal inference methods.
